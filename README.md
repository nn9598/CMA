This is the beginning of a larger project I'm tackling. The end goal is to integrate with the google maps API and a noSQL database to allow the user to enter some valid polk county address, pull comparable properties within some predefined radius (say, 1 mile) and assign a market value based on adjustments made to the comparable properties. My program so far sets up a backend through node and express.js with DB integration, and a front-end that takes a user inputed address and checks the DB for anything matching that address. If there is a match, that proerty data is logged in the console. This is still in its early stages and is my first program that ties together Front-end, back-end and database, so I'm happy with the progress but have much to learn still.
